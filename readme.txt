Enable excerpts in the Blog Post Feed for posts that use the Divi Builder Text Module

== Description ==

**Feed Excerpts For Divi** is a simple plugin for the Divi Theme by Elegant Themes. This plugin provides excerpts for the Blog Post Feed when the Feed is set to show the **Summary** instead of **Full Text**.

WordPress filters out shortcodes when it is set to **Summary**, which leaves the feed content empty for posts using the Divi Builder. This plugin resolves that by generating an excerpt from the first Text Module on the post where the Divi Builder is enabled.
